## Philosophy: 
No two machine learning projects are the same, but every machine learning project is in some way similar. 

Most projects can be broken up into discrete parts, which inform one another. It is likely possible to set up exemplary frameworks which can form the backbone of a variety of ML projects. Additionally by splitting the examples and segments of the plan into parts, then hopefully they can be more readily taken and pieced together as needed. 

The framework will be set up such that users can spend more of their time on design choices relevant to the realities of their project. (Example: The penalties around false negatives and false positives often being different)


## Installation
